### Automatically Clear Jupyter Outputs before committing ###
Run the following to have the jupyter notebook outputs cleared so that my github stats stay pure 🙏
`python3 -m pip install nbstripout`
`python3 -m nbstripout --install --global`
If it doesn't work just make sure you always clear outputs before committing
